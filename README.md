# Raptors-Stats-Leaders

Using [balldontlie](https://balldontlie.io) API, I represent the top five players for each stat category for the Toronto Raptors basketball team.

This is part of my mini-project series to showcase the Frontend skills that I've been reviewing to prepare myself for the job market.

In this project here are some skills that I showcase:

- Fetch API
- Async/Await
- Event handling
